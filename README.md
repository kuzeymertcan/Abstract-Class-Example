### Project Overview:

The Java code is a comprehensive example of object-oriented programming, demonstrating the use of abstract classes and inheritance to model both 2D and 3D shapes. The project includes classes representing various shapes, including circles, squares, rectangles, cylinders, spheres, pyramids, and cones.

### Key Features:

1. **Abstract Classes:**
   - `Shape2D` is an abstract class representing 2D shapes with common attributes like height, width, and radius. It contains an abstract method `getArea()` and overrides `toString()`.
   - `Shape3D` extends `Shape2D` and represents 3D shapes with an additional attribute, depth. It declares an abstract method `getVolume()`.

2. **Concrete Classes (2D Shapes):**
   - `Circle`, `Square`, and `Rectangle` are concrete classes extending `Shape2D`. They provide specific implementations for `getArea()` and `toString()`.

3. **Concrete Classes (3D Shapes):**
   - `Cylinder`, `Sphere`, `Pyramid`, and `Cone` are concrete classes extending `Shape3D`. They provide specific implementations for both `getArea()` and `getVolume()`.

4. **Main Class:**
   - The `Main` class serves as a test environment, creating instances of different shapes and storing them in an array.
   - It demonstrates polymorphism by iterating through the array of `Shape2D` objects and printing information about each shape.

5. **Output Example:**
   - The provided output shows details of each shape, including dimensions, volume, and area, showcasing the functionality of the implemented classes.

### Usage:
1. **2D Shapes:**
   - Create instances of `Circle`, `Square`, and `Rectangle` by providing appropriate dimensions.
   - Override `toString()` to display information about each shape.

2. **3D Shapes:**
   - Create instances of `Cylinder`, `Sphere`, `Pyramid`, and `Cone` by providing appropriate dimensions.
   - Override `toString()` to display information about each shape, including volume and area.

3. **Polymorphism:**
   - Utilize polymorphism by storing different shapes in an array of `Shape2D` and iterating through them in the `Main` class.

### Future Considerations:
   - Consider adding more shapes or features to expand the project.
   - Enhance documentation with detailed comments or additional files.
   - Explore incorporating unit tests to ensure the correctness of shape calculations.

The provided code effectively demonstrates object-oriented principles and can serve as a foundation for expanding a geometry-related project.
